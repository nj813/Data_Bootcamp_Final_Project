    "## Final Proposal: Airbnb Case Study in New York City##\n",
    "#### Principal Investigator: Nan Jiang <br> Email: [nancy.jiang@nyu.edu](nancy.jiang@nyu.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will study how pricing of listed Airbnb accommodation within New York City is subject to location, room types and number of reviews as well as how it compares with neighboring hotels. Specifically, New York City, due to its enormous traffic flow and skyrocketing rental fees, accommocates a huge airbnb market across its 5 distinct boroughs. This project will group current Airbnb listings by roomtypes and boroughs and visualize the outstanding difference in prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key element of the project is the use of [NYC Airbnb Listing Dataset](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2018-03-04/visualisations/listings.csv) and [Yelp's API](https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/{id)  (This part I still need some time to figure out). The dataset is a thorough collection of data on prices, whereabouts and room type of each listing. While the latter provides access to price levels of some selection of hotels in the neighborhood, which gives a rough sense how airbnb prices would compare across. Details of this dataset are described below in the data report.\n",
    "\n",
    "I anticipate that the project will have three sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic statistics about the breakdown of room types and difference in average pricing across boroughs will be reported. What is the cheapest/most expensive combination of boroughs and room_type to stay at?\n",
    "\n",
    "- An analysis on how Airbnb accommodation compares to neighboring hotels in terms of prices. Specifically, I would like to compute the average Airbnb price within each borough and compare it to average hotel price within the neignbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An analysis on how occupancy rate differ due to number of reviews and timing of the year within the borough that has the most listings."

    "**Overview:** The data behind my project comes from the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/). It is an independent, non-commercial set of data that aggregated all publicly avaliable information of Airbnb listings across the world. Their [NYC Airbnb Listing Dataset](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2018-03-04/visualisations/listings.csv) provides access to key metrics and information including, prices, location, room type, number of reviews and dates of availability for each listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Variables:** The key series of variables I will be focusing on in this project include the prices and neighborhood of the listing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my report I will also try to get access to Yelp's API to understand average hotel prices within different neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Geography* that I will work with is New York City. However, the same analysis could be easily applied to other cities as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access** I will use [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) to download and access the core dataset. Below I demonstrate that I have the ability to access the data."
